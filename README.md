# ClearableEditText
EditText with option to clear the content.
This customized view contains a Button inside the EditText itself, so just on pressing this Button only once, you can clear all the text written within the EditText.

I have also added one more interesting feature to ClearableEditText view. Your clear button will be visible only when it will have text written in it otherwise it will be invisible.
